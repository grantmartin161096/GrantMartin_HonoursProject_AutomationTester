# GrantMartin_HonoursProject_AutomationTester
Automation Tester is a desktop application which allows Manual testers to automate test scripts and replay them easily with no coding experience needed.
The main aim of this Honours Project is to implement an Automation Testing Desktop Application that will allow unskilled Manual Software Testers to automate test scripts quickly and efficiently, without having to know or understand any software development languages and coding concepts. This type of desktop application will resolve the problem of having to perform Regression testing on the test subject, before each new application release or after every developer change to the test application code, this can take up huge amounts of testing time in a software development project and over the lifecycle of the product application.
